Universal 2D engine with integrated visual custom programming language written in C#

Poly Engine is a universal 2D engine with integrated custom procedural programming language in text & visual form. The engine allows user to create basic simulations, operations, prototypes, presentations & games by creating logical node-branches in built-in visual programming language or writing directly in source code. Poly Engine is fully ready for beginners and new programmers as a clear & simple introduction to the computer mathematics & algorithms with fun way. The engine also allows user to build project as a standalone-executable program, which makes the app accessible for anyone. The style of the visual programming is very similar to the Unreal Engine Blueprints & [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Syntax & semantics of the integrated language can be compared to C, PHP, VBS or Python.
