# Poly-Engine
Universal 2D engine with integrated visual programming language written in C#

Poly Engine is a universal 2D engine containing procedural programming language in text & visual form. The engine allows you to create basic simulations, operations, prototypes, presentations & also games by creating logical node-branches in built-in visual programming language or writing directly in source code. Engine supports several events & methods which can be used in realtime programming including Start Event & Update Event. The style of the visual programming is very similar to Unreal Engine Blueprints & Scratch. Syntax & semantics of the integrated language can be compared to C# or Python.
